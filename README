pgbtreecheck runs some simple checks on Postgres b-tree indexes.

It's written in Perl and receives the output from pg_filedump.
It then recreates the tree and runs some simple checks to verify consistency
of the tree metadata.

Any problem found is reported as a WARNING.

You can find pg_filedump at http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgfiledump
